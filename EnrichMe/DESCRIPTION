Description: This package perform GSEA on a ranked list of objects and set of objects as genes.
    The second method to test assosociation between gene set and ranked list of objects is to retrieve the leading-edge subset and then perform a Fisher's exact test. 
    It also gives the possibility to automatically search set of genes from different database from the web.
    Finally, it gives some functions to visiulize the result of GSEA.
