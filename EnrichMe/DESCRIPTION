Description: This package perform GSEA on a ranked list of objects and set
    of objects as genes.  The second method to test assosociation between
    gene set and ranked list of objects is to retrieve the leading-edge
    subset and then perform a Fisher's exact test.  It also gives the
    possibility to automatically search set of genes from different
    database from the web.  Finally, it gives some functions to visiulize
    the result of GSEA.
