Description: This package performs a GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) 
    on a ranked list of objects and set of objects as genes.  
    The second method of this package, tests association between
    gene set and ranked list of objects by retrieving the leading-edge
    subset and performing a Fisher's exact test.  It also gives the
    possibility to automatically search set of genes from different
    databases on the web.  Finally, it gives some functions to visualize
    the result of GSEA.
